    "\n",
    "**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Targets:**\n",
    "* **Latency Target**: p95 latency of ≤ 200ms for end-to-end predictions.\n",
    "* **Traffic Estimate**: Approximately 500 prediction requests per day.\n",
    "* **Cost Envelope**: Target of ≈ $80/month, covering compute, monitoring, and storage.\n",
    "* **Update Cadence**: Features will be refreshed daily, with a full model retrain scheduled monthly.\n",
    "* **Fallback Plan**: If the real-time API is unavailable for more than 5 minutes, the system will fall back to serving nightly cached batch scores."

    "3.  **Log & Register**: Log all artifacts, metrics, and parameters to **MLflow**.\n",
    "4.  **Promotion Gate**: Automatically compare the candidate to the production model. To be promoted, the candidate must show superior recall and precision and have a bias metric within a ±2 pp threshold.\n",
    "5.  **Deploy**: If the gate is passed, the model's stage in MLflow is updated to \"Production,\" and **ArgoCD** syncs the new Helm chart to the EKS cluster."
