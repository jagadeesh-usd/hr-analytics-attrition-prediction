    "\n",
    "**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) & Targets:**\n",
    "* **Latency Target**: p95 latency of ≤ 200ms for end-to-end predictions.\n",
    "* **Traffic Estimate**: Approximately 500 prediction requests per day.\n",
    "* **Cost Envelope**: Target of ≈ $80/month, covering compute, monitoring, and storage.\n",
    "* **Update Cadence**: Features will be refreshed daily, with a full model retrain scheduled monthly.\n",
    "* **Fallback Plan**: If the real-time API is unavailable for more than 5 minutes, the system will fall back to serving nightly cached batch scores."

    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Processing**: A processing step pulls the latest data and prepares features using the SageMaker Feature Store.\n",
    "2.  **Train Model**: A training step launches a SageMaker Training Job to train the candidate model.\n",
    "3.  **Evaluate Model**: An evaluation step compares the candidate model's performance (e.g., recall, precision) against a baseline on a hold-out dataset.\n",
    "4.  **Register Model**: If the new model meets the performance criteria, it is versioned and registered in the **SageMaker Model Registry** with a \"Pending Approval\" status.\n",
    "5.  **Deploy**: Upon manual approval (or an automated rule), a final step in the pipeline deploys the approved model version to the production SageMaker Endpoint, automatically updating it with zero downtime."

    "* **Ethical Use**: The model serves as a decision-support tool. It is not fully automated. A human manager is always in the loop and must record a reason for any action taken.\n",
    "* **Regulatory Compliance**: The system and its data handling procedures are designed for compliance with GDPR, India's PDP, and EEOC AI guidance, with checks performed quarterly."
