    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Employee attrition is a critical issue for organizations across industries. When experienced employees leave, it results in not only recruitment and training costs but also lost productivity, institutional knowledge, and potential damage to team morale. High attrition may indicate deeper organizational issues such as low employee satisfaction, lack of career growth, or poor management practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Need\n",
    "\n",
    "The organization seeks to understand the underlying drivers of employee attrition and proactively identify at-risk employees. A data-driven approach will help HR teams target retention efforts more efficiently, thereby minimizing attrition-related costs and improving organizational stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategic Importance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improve employee engagement and job satisfaction\n",
    "- Reduce turnover-related expenses\n",
    "- Design better career development and benefits programs\n",
    "- Strengthen workforce planning and talent management\n",

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts whether an employee is likely to leave the organization based on their demographic, job-related, and satisfaction-related attributes. The model will help the HR team prioritize interventions, design targeted policies, and improve retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key business questions include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the most significant factors contributing to attrition?\n",
    "- Can we accurately predict which employees are most likely to leave?\n",
    "- How can these insights be used to reduce voluntary turnover?\n",
    "\n",
    "The expected outcome is a predictive model that can identify at-risk employees with high reliability, along with interpretable insights to inform HR policies and practices.\n",
